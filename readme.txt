Contributers: James Eggers
Description: Portfolleo is a Simple, Intuitive Portfolio Plugin for wordpress that creates a very good-looking portfolio that uses JQuery. It is very very very easy to use and is quite fast. I created it because there really wasn't any plugin that just created a whole portfolio, that looks amazing. So, thats what Portfolleo does, it creates an amazing portfolio almost without any input from the user. Its also highly customizable.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

	= Why can I not see the left and right arrows on my portfolio? =
	
Try editing the css, every theme is different and the arrows may be spaced to far or 
to close together. The css file is in /wp-content/plugins/portfolleo/static/css/style.css.

	= The form says that my slide has been added, but nothing has happened? =

This is most likely because you did not put <div id="slidesContainer"> </div> in the 
portfolio page, make sure you use the html editing mode.
